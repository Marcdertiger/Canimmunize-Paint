# Canimmunize-Paint

A short coding challenge. 

I left out state management (redux) in this version.

App state is centralized to the Pixelize.jsx file. Moving to state management in this format would not be very difficult. 
I however have little experience setting up and building the required store/reducers/actions and left it out in favor of shorter 
dev time.

To Do : 

Brush up ground up redux
Improve layout
Fix Fill functionality and expand it to cover all connected squares.
